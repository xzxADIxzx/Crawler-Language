# Crawler Language
This language is conceptual and designed to be.

## Alphabet
The crawler alphabet has 19 letters and no capitals.   
a b c d e g h i l m n o p r s t u w y

Some combinations of letters form their own sounds.   
th[ð] ph[θ] sh[ʂ]

Some signs have their own name and are pronounced in speech.   
?[as'] ![vɒu]

## Word Formation
Everything is simple, there are roots and endings needed to change the meaning of the word.
Roots are at the beginning, and endings get rid of the root with the sing \` or if you like '.
There are only a few endings and each has its own semantic meaning.   
e[plural] i[verb] or[occupation]   
Ending *e* can be combined with ending *or*.

* ingin - engineering
* ingin\`or - engineer
* ingin\`ore - engineers
* ingin\`i - to engineer

## Sentence Formation
The basic word order in this language is SVO.
In a sentence, the subject is separated from the verb with *dot*, and the verb from the object with *toi*.
Sentences are separated by a sign  and a particle of time is put at the end, but for convenience, you can separate by a dot and not put a particle.

* ayowl dot spiar\`i toi yoy niw  yoy dot wioko\`i ma ayowl niw
* ayowl dot spiar\`i toi yoy . yoy dot wioko\`i ma ayowl

The language also has subordinate clauses, but they are separated not by commas, but by the question to which they answer. 
If **you** perform the actions, then the subordinate conjunctions *ma* and *coho* are replaced by *toi*.
It came from the very old crawler language.

* eto\`e dot wioko\`i coho ingin\`or . eto\`e dot nim\`i ma waoma
* ayowl dot wioko\`i toi ingin\`or . ayowl dot nim\`i toi waoma

There are well-established expressions in the language, i.e. instead of *ayowl dot cu\`i toi yoy* you can say just *cu*.
Or for example *nim nim* translates as delicious.
