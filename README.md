# Crawler Language
This language is conceptual and designed to be.   
The mod can be downloaded from the in-game mod browser.   
If something does not suit you, create an issue.

## Alphabet
The crawler alphabet has 19 letters and no capitals.   
a b c d e g h i l m n o p r s t u w y

Some combinations of letters form their own sounds.   
th[ð] ph[θ] sh[ʂ] ch[t͡ɕ]

Some signs have their own name and are pronounced in speech.   
?[as'] ![vɒu]

## Word Formation
Everything is simple, there are roots and endings needed to change the meaning of the word.
Roots are at the beginning, and endings get rid of the root with the sing \` or if you like '.
There are only a few endings and each has its own semantic meaning.   
e[plural] i[verb] or[occupation] thio[transformation]   
Ending *e* can be combined with ending *or*.

* ingin - engineering
* ingin\`or - engineer
* ingin\`ore - engineers
* ingin\`i - to engineer

## Sentence Formation
The basic word order in this language is SVO.
In a sentence, the subject is separated from the predicate with *dot*.
Sentences are separated by a dot and a particle of time is placed at the end, but for convenience, you can not put a particle of time if the previous sentence has a particle of the same time, or replace it with a subordinate clause.

* ayowl dot spiar\`i coho yoy niw . yoy dot wioko\`i ma ayowl niw
* ayowl dot spiar\`i coho yoy niw . yoy dot wioko\`i ma ayowl

The language also has subordinate clauses, but they are separated not by commas, but by the question to which they answer.
In a very old version of the language, instead of the subordinating conjunctions *ma* and *coho* it was *toi*, but now this conjunction means *in what* or *what to*.

* ayowl dot wioko\`i coho ingin\`or niw
* ayowl dot nim\`i ma waoma niw

There are well-established expressions in the language, i.e. instead of *ayowl dot cu\`i coho yoy niw* you can say just *cu*.
Or for example *nim nim* translates as delicious.
