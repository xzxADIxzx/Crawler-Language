# Crawler Language
This language is conceptual and designed to be.   
The mod can be downloaded from the in-game mod browser.   
If something does not suit you, create an issue.

## Alphabet
The crawler alphabet has 19 letters and no capitals.   
a b c d e g h i l m n o p r s t u w y

Some combinations of letters form their own sounds.   
th[ð] ph[θ] sh[ʂ] ch[t͡ɕ]

Some signs have their own name and are pronounced in speech.   
?[as'] ![vɒu] |[ɲj]

## Word Formation
Everything is simple, there are roots, prefixes and endings, the last two are needed to change the meaning of the word.
Prefixes are at the beginning, roots are in the middle, and endings are separated from the root with the sign \`.
There are only a few endings and prefixes.   
e[plural] i[verb] or[occupation] thio[transformation]   
al[all] aly[any] no[negation] la[adjective] tha[forced adjective] othe[other] re[repetition] ay[self] sau[start of action]   
Ending *e* and *thio* can be combined with ending *or*.
Ending *thio* can be used as a noun or verb.

* ingin - engineering
* ingin\`or - engineer
* ingin\`ore - engineers
* ingin\`i - to engineer
* ingin\`thio - becoming an engineer
* ingin\`thior - mentor engineer
* otheingin\`or - other engineer
* lamawo - wet
* thamawo - wetted

### Adjectives
Adjectives are formed using the prefixes *la* and *tha*, the latter means that the characteristic was given to the subject forcibly.

* lawuic - fast
* thasouwl - slow**ed**

If the adjective comes before the word to which it refers, then the prefix *la* is not put for reasons of space.

* wuic ayowl dot wuic nim`i
* wuic ener pharom ayowl

## Sentence Formation
The basic word order in this language is SVO.
In a sentence, the subject is separated from the predicate with *dot*.
Sentences are separated by a dot and a particle of time is placed at the end, but for convenience, you can not put a particle of time if the previous sentence has a particle of the same time, or replace it with a subordinate clause.

* ayowl dot spiar\`i coho yoy niw . yoy dot wioko\`i ma imgur niw
* ayowl dot spiar\`i coho yoy niw . yoy dot wioko\`i ma imgur

The language also has subordinate clauses, but they are separated not by commas, but by the question to which they answer.
In a very old version of the language, instead of the subordinating conjunctions *ma* and *coho* it was *toi*, but now this conjunction means *into*.

* ayowl dot wioko\`i coho ingin\`or niw
* ayowl dot nim\`i ma waoma niw

If the sentence does not end after the complex part, then you need to put the sign |.

* ayowl dot wioko\`i ma spor niw
* adpromet ma medi| arch wuic phur

There are well-established expressions in the language, i.e. instead of *ayowl dot cu\`i coho yoy niw* you can say just *cu*.
Or for example *nim nim* translates as delicious.
